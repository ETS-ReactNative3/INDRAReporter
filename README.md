# International Natural Disasters Research and Analytics (INDRA)
---
INDRA Reporter (International Natural Disasters Research and Analytics) is a free app for crowdsourcing reports on weather and water-related natural hazards such as floods, heavy rains, landslides etc. from citizen scientists. This app is a part of Project INDRA, which is building a comprehensive multi-platform framework using apps, chat bots, web forms etc.

The freely available data is used for understanding and predicting these phenomenon. An example application would be developing better prediction models for flood inundation using INDRA flood level reports.
